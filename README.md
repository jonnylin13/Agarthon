# Agarthon by jonnylin13

An agar.io python client made in Python 3.4.3. I will be improving this as my main project for learning purposes, so do what you will with this. It's not coded very well and I would love some help/feedback!

# Disclaimer

I have pretty much no idea what I'm doing, this is my first personal project so I would love help/tips/feedback!

# Todo

- Create a buffer/packet class to read and write packets
- Personally learn the struct class and how to pack/unpack
- Create actual gameviewer/game class to display
- Lots more

# Dependencies
- `pip install requests`
- pygame for Python 3.4.3

# Usage
- Just run agarthon.py
- `python agarthon.py`
