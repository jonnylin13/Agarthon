# Agarthon by jonnylin13

An agar.io python client made in Python 3.4.3. I will be improving this as my main project for learning purposes, so do what you will with this. It's not coded very well and I would love some help/feedback!

# Disclaimer

I have pretty much no idea what I'm doing, this is my first personal project so I would love help/tips/feedback!
- Also big thanks to Raeon for helping me through a lot of the packet packing/unpacking!

# Dependencies
- `pip install requests`
- pygame for Python 3.4.3

# Usage
- Just run run.py
- `python run.py`

# Todo

- Create actual gameviewer/game class to display

# Done
- Create an HTTP request to http://m.agar.io to retrieve server information
- Create websocket connection + send connection token packet
- Created methods for all client to server interactions
