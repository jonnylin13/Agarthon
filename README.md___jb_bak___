# Agarthon by jonnylin13

An agar.io python client made in Python 3.4.3. I will be improving this as my main project for learning purposes, so do what you will with this. It's not coded very well and I would love some help/feedback!

# Dependencies
`pip install requests`
pygame for Python 3.4.3

# Usage
Just run agarthon.py
`python agarthon.py`
